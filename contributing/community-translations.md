# Community Translations

We are grateful for the contributions of the community in translating our [Open Source Education Path](https://opensauced.pizza/learn/#/). Although the OpenSauced team does not currently maintain these translation, we want to share the forked repositories with those taking the course.

> [!NOTE]
> If you'd like to improve a translation, you can contact the maintainers of the forked repository. If you'd like to translate our Open Source Education materials, please read our [🌐 i18n Guidelines](i18n-guidelines.md).
